# BeCarfortable

## Overview
BeCarfortable is a Python application developed for the "Industrial Application" course as part of the MSC 
in Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering at the University of Pisa. The objective of this application 
is to develop an intelligent evaluation system for a car-sharing service using face emotion recognition. 
We leveraged two distinct frameworks, DeepFace and Emonet, for this purpose. The application was deployed 
both locally and on a Raspberry Pi 3 model B.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains:

- `emonet`: This directory contains files related to the Emonet model.
- `pretrained`: This directory contains pretrained models.
- `raspberry`: This directory contains files related to Raspberry Pi.
- `server`: This directory contains server-related files.
- `emonet_classifier.py`: This is a Python script related to the Emonet model.
