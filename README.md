===========================

Official implementation of the paper "Estimation of continuous valence and arousal levels from faces in naturalistic conditions" by Antoine Toisoul, Jean Kossaifi, Adrian Bulat, Georgios Tzimiropoulos and Maja Pantic published at Nature Machine Intelligence, January 2020. 
Work done in collaboration between Samsung AI Center Cambridge and Imperial College London.

The code requires the following Python packages : 

```
  Pytorch (tested on version 1.2.0)
  OpenCV (tested on version 4.1.0
  skimage (tested on version 0.15.0)
```

We provide two pretrained models : one on 5 emotional classes and one on 8 classes. In addition to categorical emotions, both models also predict valence and arousal values as well as facial landmarks.

To evaluate the pretrained models on the cleaned test sets, simply run : 

```
  python test.py --nclass 8
```

where nclass defines which model you would like to test (5 or 8).

The program will output the following results :

Results on AffectNet cleaned test set for 5 classes
------------------------

```
 Expression
  ACC=0.82

 Valence
  CCC=0.90, PCC=0.90, RMSE=0.24, SAGR=0.85
 Arousal

```

Results on AffectNet cleaned test set for 8 classes
------------------------

```
  Expression
    ACC=0.75

  Valence
    CCC=0.82, PCC=0.82, RMSE=0.29, SAGR=0.84
  Arousal
